**Will there be a c++ implementation?**

Certainly feasible and if there's a need. If such a things should come to pass though, the
c++ implementation should compliment this one. That is, it should focus on decision making
for systems with low latency and reactive requirements. It would use triggers to tick
the tree instead of tick-tock and a few other tricks that have evolved in the gaming
industry over the last few years. Having a c++ implementation for use in the control
layer of a robotics system would be a driving use case.
