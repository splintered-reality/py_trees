# Py Trees

This is a python implementation of behaviour trees designed to facilitate the rapid development
of medium sized decision making engines for use in fields like robotics. Brief feature list:

* Sequence, Selector, Parallel and Chooser composites
* Blackboards for data sharing
* Python generators for smarter ticking over the tree graph
* Python decorators for enabling meta behaviours
* Render trees to dot graphs or visualise with ascii graphs on stdout

Detailed api reference and demo instructions can be found in the [sphinx documentation](http://py-trees.readthedocs.io/) for the package. There is also the [py_trees_ros](https://github.com/stonier/py_trees_ros/tree/devel) package which includes additional modules and documentation for using py_trees with ROS.

## Getting Started

**Installation**

From [ppa](https://launchpad.net/~d-stonier/+archive/ubuntu/snorriheim) on Ubuntu/Xenial

```
sudo apt install python-py-trees
```

From [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py_trees):

```
pip install py_trees
```

Or in a sandboxed ROS Kinetic environment (coming soon):

```
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-py-trees
```

**Development**

You can develop in either a virtualenv (python style):

```
# python 2
source ./virtualenv.bash
# python 3
source ./virtualenv3.bash
```

or in a catkin environment alongside other ROS py-trees packages:
